            lodging system is to manage all the complaints of faculty members,
            students, teaching assistants, admin, and other staff members of
            North South University to create a user-friendly and convenient
            application. We will have a database server managing many users
            and thousands of complaints by students, faculty members and
            others. We hope to provide an easy-to-use application so that
            users can lodge their complaints without any hassle.

          <p>
            The product name is NSU-CLS. The project is a complaint lodging
            system of North South University. This system manages all the
            complaints lodged by faculty members, students, teaching
            assistants, admin, and other university staff members. Faculty
            members and admin can review the complaints. It also contains the
            user's name, NSU-Id, email address, and additional information. This is a new self-contained product.

            <li>
              Users can lodge their complaints with proper evidence and choose
              a reviewer for the complaint. Students, faculty members,

          <h4>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
          <p>The backend of NSU-CLS is developed using NodeJS (ExpressJS), and the frontend part is built on
            ReactJS. The backend and frontend are connected through well-written APIs.
            For mobile, the android application is developed using Java. People using devices with
            Android versions lower than seven can not use the android version of this application.</p>

        <div class="item">
          <h4>2.6 User Documentation</h4>
          <p>The product will provide users with basic running instructions. There is a part named ‘How to Complain’
            where users will
            get guidelines on how they can lodge a complaint.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          <h4>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
          <p>The user must have an active internet connection to utilize the system. For web users, there must be a
            browser to access this product. Mobile users must have a minimum of Android version 7 installed. A user can
            lodge a complaint then. The user can lodge the complaint through speech using the android app. After lodging
            a complaint, the user, the reviewer and sysadmins will be notified via email.</p>

          <h4>3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
          <p>
            The system will take the user to the home page first. Then the user needs to sign in to the system with the
            correct credentials. If the user is not
            registered, he will be redirected to the sign-up page, and he needs to
            register to the system with all the correct information. A user can also sign up
            and sign in through Google sign-up and Google sign-in.
            Students, faculty members, admin members, teaching assistants have to sign up using NSU email.
            After signing in successfully
            a user can lodge complaints, and there is an option to choose a reviewer for the
            complaints (which is mandatory). In the case of an android application, a user can lodge
            Complaint through speech as there is a Bangla speech recognizer that converts
            Speech to text.
            A user can lodge complaints against multiple
            people. An email will be sent to the lodger, reviewer, and sysadmin to notify them. The lodger should also
            attach proper evidence.
            Moreover, the lodger has the opportunity to edit, remove or change the reviewer.
            The user's information will be stored, including their image(which will be taken from their NSU-ID's scan
            copy) in the user's profile. There will be a Logout button to exit from the system.
